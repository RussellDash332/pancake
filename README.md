Known for somewhat solving [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Waffle](https://wafflegame.net/).

## Usage
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you're doing the regular Waffle on Windows, run `main.py` as is since this can be automated. Otherwise, do copy your whole HTML page source to `run.html`. You may repeat this process over and over.

Note that you can't `Ctrl+U` this thing, so here's how you can do it:

I only learnt CS2040 and CS3243, so those are where this can go as far as.
